# Security-Lab-Infrastructure
An attempt at building small scale, repeatable (but not reproducible), Security Labs for the small scale researcher

## What is this?
I have noticed that most configuration management, and virtual infrastructure management, focuses on users with more resources. 
This is my attempt to fill the gap. Right now it's home to a few configs and commands and none of them are production ready. 
Some flat out don't work yet.

## Where is this going?
One of the harder parts of doing small scale research is sometimes choosing your tooling and rarely does anybody discuss the whys.
My Plan is to provide configurations and technology choices so that you can either use mine, or you can at least have a good base to
start your own.

### Future Plans
- Puppet
- Virtual Machine Image Builds
- ConfigurationsI
- Convenient Shell Scripts
- Actual Write-ups
# Security-Lab-Infrastructure [ARCHIVED]

**This repository has been archived and superseded by [Kali-Bootstrap-Documentation].**

## Why Archive Instead of Delete?

This repo contains exploratory work and proof-of-concept scripts that demonstrate useful patterns, even if the overall structure has been superseded.

### Notable Scripts Worth Preserving

- **javascript-apocalypse.sh** - Demonstrates aptitude tagging for tracking transitive JavaScript dependencies across multiple package managers
- **dependency-detective.sh** - Forensic analysis for orphaned package dependencies
- **apt-tag system** - Semantic package management using aptitude user tags

These scripts showcase problem-solving approaches that may be useful as reference material.

## What Replaced This?

The systematic documentation project at [new repo link] takes a more structured approach with:
- Epistemological transparency (explaining *why* not just *how*)
- Modular decision points
- Threat modeling
- Anti-cargo-culting documentation

This archive remains as a record of the exploratory phase that led to that methodology.
