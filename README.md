# Security-Lab-Infrastructure
An attempt at building small scale, replicatable, but not reproducible, Security Labs for the small scale researcher

## What is this?
I have noticed that most configuration management, and virtual infrastructure management, focuses on users with more resources. 
This is my attempt to fill the gap. Right now it's home to a few configs and commands and none of them are production ready. 
Some flat don't work yet.

## Where is this going?
One of the harder parts of doing small scale research is somethimes choosing your tooling and rarely does anybody discuss the whys.
My Plan is to provide configurations and technology choices so that you can either use mine, or you can at least have a good base to
start your own.

### Future Plans
- Puppet
- Virtual Machine Image Builds
- Configurations
- Convenient Shell Scripts
- Actual Write-ups
